## Security Features

### **Organization Isolation**
- **Data Segregation**: Departments are isolated by organization ID
- **User Verification**: All operations verify user belongs to organization
- **Permission Checks**: Delete operations require admin role
- **Firestore Rules**: Comprehensive security rules for departments collection

### **Firestore Security Rules**
```javascript
// Departments - Organization Isolation
match /departments/{departmentId} {
  // Allow read only if user belongs to the same organization
  allow read: if isSignedIn() && 
    exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/organizations/$(resource.data.organizationId)/users/$(request.auth.uid));
  
  // Allow create if user is authenticated and setting their own organization
  allow create: if isSignedIn() && 
    exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/organizations/$(request.resource.data.organizationId)/users/$(request.auth.uid));
  
  // Allow update if user belongs to the same organization
  allow update: if isSignedIn() && 
    exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/organizations/$(resource.data.organizationId)/users/$(request.auth.uid));
  
  // Allow delete if user belongs to the same organization and is admin
  allow delete: if isSignedIn() && 
    exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/organizations/$(resource.data.organizationId)/users/$(request.auth.uid)) &&
    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/organizations/$(resource.data.organizationId)/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
}
```

## Error Handling

### **Validation Errors**

## Performance Considerations

### **Data Loading**
